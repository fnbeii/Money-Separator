MoneySeparator is a (adapted) plugin for GTA SA and Vice City that uses AML (Android Modloader).

The code hooks into a crucial function call to return the current player's money text string, then modifies the text and adds numeric separators using a function created by Musaigen.

A configuration .ini file will be created automatically, allowing you to change the separator to a comma, period, etc.
If you want only one space, type "space" in the ˋSeparatorˋ value of the .ini file.
